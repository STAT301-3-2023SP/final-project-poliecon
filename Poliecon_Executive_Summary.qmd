## Introduction

In this final project, our objective is to leverage eight independent variables to predict the voting participation of American youths, using data from the Youth Post-Election Survey 2012. It has been consistently observed that young adults (ages 18-24) vote at significantly lower rates than other age groups in the U.S. (Levine 2016). As indicated by the attached figure, only 60 percent of youths voted in the 2012 elections within this dataset. Consequently, comprehending why some youths choose to vote while others do not, and predicting youth voting behavior based on factors such as demographics, socioeconomic backgrounds, education, and socialization, carries immense importance. This understanding not only enriches our knowledge on youth civic engagement but also informs strategies to enhance their participation in democratic processes.

## Main Analysis
We tested two different recipes on 8 different types of models: null modelling, boosted tree (bt), elastic net (en), k nearest neighbor (knn), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Single layer neural network (slnn), SVM poly, and SVM radial. In total, we have fitted 16 models. Among them, the winning model is. The best-performing model turned out to be Elastic Net Recipe 2. This model yielded the highest ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve) score of 0.7354077 when predicting the response variable on the training data. Additionally, we have provided the runtimes for all 16 models. Our winning model took 69 seconds, which, while not the fastest, was reasonable considering its performance.


```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(gt)

load("final_results/final_tables.rda")

 ranked_mods <- gt(best_models) %>% 
   cols_label(wflow_id = html("Model Type"),
              mean = html("Mean"),
              rank = html("Rank")
   ) %>% 
   tab_header(
     title = md("**Top Ranked Models**"),
     subtitle = "Metric = ROC-AUC"
   )
 
 ranked_mods

```


Therefore, we fit this winning model into our testing set. It yields an roc-auc of ????????

## Conclusion

This project suggests that the elastic net model can accurately predict youth voting using 4000 cases, which holds significant theoretical and practical implications.

From a theoretical perspective, future studies can be undertaken to identify which features are most crucial in making these predictions. This will enhance our understanding of the motivations and constraints faced by American youths when they participate in politics.

Meanwhile, future research in this field has substantial policy implications. As youth voting should be encouraged, our research will help predict in advance of elections whether particular youths are likely to vote or not. This, in turn, can guide targeted efforts to encourage those who are predicted not to vote, fostering greater political engagement among the youth.

In conclusion, our project not only contributes to a better understanding of the patterns and determinants of youth voting behavior but also provides insights that can be used to promote civic participation among this important demographic.
